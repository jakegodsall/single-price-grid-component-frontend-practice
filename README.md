## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- That by using `height:100vh` property for the `body`, there is a chance of cutting off content when loaded on a mobile device. 
- That vertical centring is not really necessary for mobile development, and hence should be employed for desktop inside a media query (when using mobile-first workflow).
- Styling `li` elements with CSS.
- How adding a `box-shadow` can be used to add a three-dimensional effect of an object even if it is the same colour as its background.

### Continued development

- To continue using the skills I have learned thus far until they become completely intuitive.
- To be more cognisant of the design principles employed at the stage prior to the challenge by the challenge author.
